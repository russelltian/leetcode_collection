## Description 

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

```
Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

## Solution

Complete Times: 3 <br/>
Difficulty: 2<br/>
Time complexity: O(logN)<br/>
Space complexity: O(1)<br/>
For a BST, the traits are LHS of a root always smaller than the root itself, and the RHS of a root is larger than itself. So we are looking for a node where it is larger than the smaller value **AND** smaller than the larger value. The corner case is **p** or **q** is equal to the root, than just return root.
